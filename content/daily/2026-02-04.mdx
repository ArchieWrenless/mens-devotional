# Today's Scripture

> "Therefore everyone who hears these words of Mine and acts on them, will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.
>
> Everyone who hears these words of Mine and does not act on them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. The rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and slammed against that house; and it fell—and great was its fall."
> — **Matthew 7:24-27 (NASB)**

## Reflection

Two builders. Same storm. Different outcomes.

Notice what makes the difference: not hearing, but *doing*. Both men heard the words. Both experienced the storm. Only one built on a foundation that held.

Jesus ends the Sermon on the Mount with this because everything else depends on it. All the beautiful teaching—blessed are the poor in spirit, love your enemies, don't worry about tomorrow—none of it matters if it stays theoretical.

The storm isn't hypothetical. It's coming. Financial trouble, health crisis, relationship breakdown, loss, doubt. The question isn't *if* but *when*. And when it hits, your foundation is already set.

## For Single Men

You're building now—whether you realize it or not. Every habit, every choice, every relationship is laying foundation. When marriage comes, when career pressure mounts, when life gets hard—you'll draw on what you built in these years. Build wisely.

## For Married Men

Your family is watching what you build on. When you handle conflict with grace, when you trust God in uncertainty, when you choose faith over fear—you're showing them what a rock foundation looks like. When you cut corners, lose your temper, or operate from anxiety—that's the sand.

## Prayer

Lord, I don't want to just hear Your words—I want to live them. Show me where I'm building on sand. Give me the courage to tear it down and rebuild on rock, even when it's costly. Amen.

## Action Step

Identify one area of your life where you hear God's truth but don't act on it. What's one step you can take today to start building on rock in that area?
