# Today's Scripture

> When Jesus came down from the mountain, large crowds followed Him. And a man with leprosy came to Him and bowed down before Him, and said, Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean. Jesus reached out with His hand and touched him, saying, I am willing; be cleansed. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
> — **Matthew 8:1-4 (NASB)**

## Reflection

The leper had two questions: Can You? Will You?

He had no doubt about Jesus' power. You can make me clean. His question was about Jesus' willingness. Would Jesus bother with someone like him? Someone untouchable? Someone who had to shout Unclean wherever he went, who had not felt human contact in years?

Jesus answered both questions with one action: He touched him.

He did not need to touch him. He healed the centurion's servant from a distance. He could have just spoken. But He touched him. Because healing the disease was not enough — He wanted to restore the man.

Before the leprosy left his skin, the shame left his soul. Someone saw him. Someone reached for him. Someone was not afraid to get close.

## For Single Men

You might feel untouchable in a different way — overlooked, passed over, invisible in a couples' world. Jesus sees you. He is not waiting for you to get your life together before He reaches out. Come to Him as you are. He is willing.

## For Married Men

Who around you feels untouchable? The coworker everyone avoids? The family member no one calls? The kid at church who does not fit in? You carry Christ's presence. You can be His hands. Sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is simply reach out.

## Prayer

Lord, thank You for being willing. Thank You for reaching into my mess rather than waiting for me to clean up. Help me do the same for others. Amen.

## Action Step

Think of someone in your life who might feel untouchable — socially awkward, struggling, avoided. Reach out to them today. A text, a call, a conversation. Be the touch of Jesus.
