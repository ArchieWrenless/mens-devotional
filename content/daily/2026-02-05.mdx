# Today's Scripture

> Lord, I am not worthy for You to come under my roof, but just say the word, and my servant will be healed. For I also am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to this one, Go! and he goes, and to another, Come! and he comes, and to my slave, Do this! and he does it.
>
> When Jesus heard this, He was amazed and said to those who were following, Truly I say to you, I have not found such great faith with anyone in Israel.
> — **Matthew 8:8-10 (NASB)**

## Reflection

A Roman centurion — a Gentile, an outsider, a military man — understood something the religious insiders missed: Jesus has authority.

The centurion did not need Jesus to show up physically. He did not need a dramatic healing ceremony. He understood chain of command. He gave orders and they happened. He recognized Jesus operated the same way — but over sickness, over nature, over everything.

Jesus was amazed. Think about that. The Son of God, impressed by a man's faith. Not by his theology degree. Not by his synagogue attendance. By his simple, complete trust that Jesus could handle it with a word.

## For Single Men

You might feel like an outsider sometimes — in church, in Christian circles, in a culture that centers on families. The centurion was an outsider too. But his position did not limit his access to Jesus. Your relationship status does not either. Faith is not about having the right life setup. It is about knowing who Jesus is and trusting Him completely.

## For Married Men

The centurion came to Jesus on behalf of someone else — his servant. As husbands and fathers, we carry the weight of others' needs constantly. Are you bringing those needs to Jesus with the same confidence? Not demanding He fix things your way, but trusting that His word is enough?

## Prayer

Lord, give me the centurion's faith. Help me trust that Your word is enough — for my problems, my family, my future. I do not need to see it to believe it. I do not need to understand it to trust it. You have authority over everything. Amen.

## Action Step

Identify one thing you have been trying to fix yourself. Today, bring it to Jesus with the centurion's attitude: Just say the word. Then let go.
