# Today's Scripture

> "Enter through the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it. For the gate is small and the way is narrow that leads to life, and there are few who find it."
> — **Matthew 7:13-14 (NASB)**

## Reflection

This isn't a popular verse. We prefer a Jesus who accepts everyone as they are, with no expectations, no demands, no narrow anything.

But here He is, drawing a line. Two gates. Two ways. Two destinations. And the easy path—the one with room to wander, the one everyone else is taking—leads to destruction.

The narrow gate isn't narrow because God is stingy. It's narrow because there's only one way in: through Christ. And the narrow way isn't narrow because God wants to make life hard. It's narrow because following Jesus actually means something. It costs something. It excludes other paths.

"Few who find it." Not because it's hidden, but because most aren't looking. The wide gate has better marketing.

## For Single Men

The world offers a wide path for single men: hook up culture, porn, self-centeredness disguised as "focusing on yourself," indefinite adolescence. The narrow path looks like purity, purpose, and preparation. It's less crowded. It's worth it.

## For Married Men

The wide path for married men is easy to spot: emotional affairs, checked-out fatherhood, work as escape, letting the marriage coast. The narrow path is daily dying to self—choosing your wife when you're tired, engaging your kids when you'd rather scroll, leading spiritually when you feel unqualified.

## Prayer

Lord, I want the narrow gate—not because I'm better than anyone, but because I know where the wide path leads. Give me the courage to choose the hard right over the easy wrong. Amen.

## Action Step

What's one area where you're tempted by the wide path right now? Name it. Confess it. Take one step toward the narrow gate today.
