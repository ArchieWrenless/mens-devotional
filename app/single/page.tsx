            Your Worth Is Not Waiting

          <blockquote className="verse-highlight">
            For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form, and in Him you have been 
            made complete. — Colossians 2:9-10 (NASB)
          </blockquote>
          <div className="mt-6 prose prose-stone">
            <p>
              Culture says you are incomplete until you find the one. Scripture says you are already 
              complete in Christ.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paul was not writing to married people. He was writing to the church — single, married, 
              widowed, all of it. And he says: you have been made complete. Past tense. Done.
            </p>
            <p>
              This does not mean marriage is bad or that wanting it is wrong. It means your value, 
              your purpose, your identity is not on hold. You are not in a waiting room. You are in 
              the arena.
            </p>
            <h3>Practical Truth</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Stop treating singleness as a problem to solve.</strong> It is a season to steward.</li>
              <li><strong>Invest deeply now.</strong> Friendships, skills, ministry, health — build while you have margin.</li>
              <li><strong>Guard against bitterness.</strong> Watching others get what you want is hard. Bring that to God honestly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Lord, help me see my life as it is — not as I wish it were. Show me how to be fully 
              present in this season. Make me a man of depth, not just a man in waiting. Amen.

            The Battle Nobody Talks About
          </h2>
          <blockquote className="verse-highlight">
            Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, 
            but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. — 1 Corinthians 6:18 (NASB)
          </blockquote>
          <div className="mt-6 prose prose-stone">
            <p>
              Lust is not just a married man's problem — and it is not just about willpower. 
              Here is what actually works.
            </p>
            <p>
              Notice Paul does not say fight or resist. He says flee. Run. Get out.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not about shame — it is about strategy. You do not negotiate with temptation. 
              You do not give it a fair hearing. You leave the room, close the browser, change 
              the environment.
            </p>
            <h3>What Actually Helps</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Accountability that is actually honest.</strong> Not "I am doing fine" every week. Real talk with a real brother.</li>
              <li><strong>Identify the triggers.</strong> Boredom? Loneliness? Stress? The sin is often a symptom.</li>
              <li><strong>Fill the void.</strong> Lust promises intimacy. Find real connection — with God, with community.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Father, I cannot white-knuckle my way to purity. I need Your Spirit. Show me where 
              I am vulnerable. Give me the humility to ask for help and the wisdom to flee. Amen.

            What Are You Building?
          </h2>
          <blockquote className="verse-highlight">
            One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please 
            the Lord. — 1 Corinthians 7:32 (NASB)

              Single men have a gift married men often envy: margin. The question is what you are 
              doing with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paul is not saying single is better than married. He is saying single has unique 
              advantages: fewer competing priorities, more flexibility, undivided focus.
            </p>
            <p>
              The danger? Wasting it. Netflix and video games are not evil, but if that is all 
              you are building, you are squandering a gift.
            </p>
            <h3>Questions to Ask Yourself</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If I got married tomorrow, what would I wish I had done while I was single?</li>
              <li>What skill, habit, or relationship am I building right now?</li>
              <li>Am I using my margin for comfort or for growth?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Lord, do not let me waste this season. Give me vision for what You want to build 
              in me and through me. Make me a man who arrives at the next season prepared, not 
              just older. Amen.
