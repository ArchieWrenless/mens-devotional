            Your Worth Isn't Waiting
          </h2>
          <p className="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            Culture says you're incomplete until you find "the one." Scripture says you're already 
            complete in Christ. Let's unpack what that actually means for how you live today.
          </p>
          <blockquote className="verse-highlight">
            "For in Him all the fullness of Deity dwells in bodily form, and in Him you have been 
            made complete." — Colossians 2:9-10 (NASB)
          </blockquote>
          <div className="mt-6 prose prose-stone">
            <p>
              Paul wasn't writing to married people. He was writing to the church—single, married, 
              widowed, all of it. And he says: <em>you have been made complete</em>. Past tense. Done.
            </p>
            <p>
              This doesn't mean marriage is bad or that wanting it is wrong. It means your value, 
              your purpose, your identity isn't on hold. You're not in a waiting room. You're in 
              the arena.
            </p>
            <h3>Practical Truth</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Stop treating singleness as a problem to solve.</strong> It's a season to steward.</li>
              <li><strong>Invest deeply now.</strong> Friendships, skills, ministry, health—build while you have margin.</li>
              <li><strong>Guard against bitterness.</strong> Watching others get what you want is hard. Bring that to God honestly.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Lord, help me see my life as it is—not as I wish it were. Show me how to be fully 
              present in this season. Make me a man of depth, not just a man in waiting. Amen.
            </p>

            The Battle Nobody Talks About
          </h2>
          <p className="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            Lust isn't just a married man's problem—and it's not just about willpower. 
            Here's what actually works.
          </p>
          <blockquote className="verse-highlight">
            "Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin that a man commits is outside the body, 
            but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body." — 1 Corinthians 6:18 (NASB)
          </blockquote>
          <div className="mt-6 prose prose-stone">
            <p>
              Notice Paul doesn't say "fight" or "resist." He says <em>flee</em>. Run. Get out.
            </p>
            <p>
              This isn't about shame—it's about strategy. You don't negotiate with temptation. 
              You don't give it a fair hearing. You leave the room, close the browser, change 
              the environment.
            </p>
            <h3>What Actually Helps</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Accountability that's actually honest.</strong> Not "I'm doing fine" every week. Real talk with a real brother.</li>
              <li><strong>Identify the triggers.</strong> Boredom? Loneliness? Stress? The sin is often a symptom.</li>
              <li><strong>Fill the void.</strong> Lust promises intimacy. Find real connection—with God, with community.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Father, I can't white-knuckle my way to purity. I need Your Spirit. Show me where 
              I'm vulnerable. Give me the humility to ask for help and the wisdom to flee. Amen.

            What Are You Building?
          </h2>
          <p className="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            Single men have a gift married men often envy: margin. The question is what you're 
            doing with it.
          </p>
          <blockquote className="verse-highlight">
            "One who is unmarried is concerned about the things of the Lord, how he may please 
            the Lord." — 1 Corinthians 7:32 (NASB)
          </blockquote>
          <div className="mt-6 prose prose-stone">
            <p>
              Paul isn't saying single is better than married. He's saying single has unique 
              advantages: fewer competing priorities, more flexibility, undivided focus.
            </p>
            <p>
              The danger? Wasting it. Netflix and video games aren't evil, but if that's all 
              you're building, you're squandering a gift.
            </p>
            <h3>Questions to Ask Yourself</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If I got married tomorrow, what would I wish I had done while I was single?</li>
              <li>What skill, habit, or relationship am I building right now?</li>
              <li>Am I using my margin for comfort or for growth?</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Lord, don't let me waste this season. Give me vision for what You want to build 
              in me and through me. Make me a man who arrives at the next season prepared, not 
              just older. Amen.
