          This site exists for one reason: to help men grow closer to God.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Whether you're single or married, young or old, new to faith or walking with 
          Jesus for decades—there's something here for you. Daily devotionals to start 
          your morning. Articles that speak to real issues men face. Scripture that 
          cuts through the noise.
        </p>

        <h2>Why "Men's Devotional"?</h2>
        <p>
          Men need spaces to be honest about their struggles without judgment. We need 
          truth that doesn't coddle but also doesn't condemn. We need practical wisdom 
          for real life—marriage, singleness, fatherhood, work, temptation, purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most devotional content is generic. This is specific. Written for the 
          challenges men actually face.
