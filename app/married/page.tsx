            Leading Without Controlling
          </h2>
          <blockquote className="verse-highlight">
            Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself 
            up for her. — Ephesians 5:25 (NASB)

              Biblical headship is not about being in charge. It is about laying down your life.
            </p>
            <p>
              The model is not a CEO. It is a crucified Savior. Christ's leadership of the church 
              looks like sacrifice, not control. Initiative, not passivity. Service, not demands. 
              That is the bar for husbands.
            </p>
            <h3>What This Looks Like</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Take initiative spiritually.</strong> Do not wait for your wife to suggest prayer or church. Lead.</li>
              <li><strong>Listen more than you fix.</strong> Sometimes she needs you to hear, not solve.</li>
              <li><strong>Apologize first.</strong> Even when you think you are right. Especially then.</li>
              <li><strong>Protect her peace.</strong> From your schedule, your stress, your parents — whatever threatens her.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Lord, make me the kind of leader who sacrifices, not demands. Help me love my wife 
              the way You love the church — patiently, selflessly, completely. Amen.

            Present Over Perfect
          </h2>
          <blockquote className="verse-highlight">
            Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline 
            and instruction of the Lord. — Ephesians 6:4 (NASB)

          <div className="mt-6 prose prose-stone">
            <p>
              Your kids do not need a perfect dad. They need a present one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Notice what comes first: do not provoke. Before instruction comes connection. 
              Before discipline comes relationship. Kids who feel loved receive correction. Kids 
              who feel criticized become resentful.
            </p>
            <h3>Practical Presence</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Phone down when you are home.</strong> They notice. Every time.</li>
              <li><strong>Enter their world.</strong> Play their games. Watch their shows. Ask about their friends by name.</li>
              <li><strong>Bedtime is sacred.</strong> That is when the real conversations happen.</li>
              <li><strong>Apologize to your kids.</strong> When you lose your temper, own it. Model repentance.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>For Blended Families</h3>
            <p>
              Stepfathering is fathering on hard mode. You are building trust without the head start 
              of biology. Give it time. Consistency over time builds what instant authority cannot.
            </p>
            <h3>Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Father, help me be the dad my kids need. Give me patience when I am tired, presence 
              when I am distracted, and wisdom when I do not know what to do. Amen.

            More Than Physical
          </h2>
          <blockquote className="verse-highlight">
            Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled.

            <p>
              A healthy marriage bed starts long before the bedroom. Here is what most men miss 
              about intimacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Men often compartmentalize: there is regular life, and then there is sex. But for 
              most wives, it is all connected. How you treat her at 7 AM affects how she feels 
              at 10 PM.
            </p>
            <h3>Building Intimacy All Day</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Pursue her emotionally.</strong> Ask real questions. Remember what she said yesterday.</li>
              <li><strong>Touch without agenda.</strong> Hug her without it leading anywhere. Hold her hand. Physical affection that is not transactional.</li>
              <li><strong>Handle your own lust.</strong> Porn, wandering eyes, emotional affairs — these kill intimacy even if she never finds out.</li>
              <li><strong>Be patient.</strong> Her desire often responds to connection, not initiation.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Lord, help me see intimacy as more than physical. Teach me to pursue my wife's 
              heart, not just her body. Make our marriage a picture of Your love for the church. Amen.

            Provider Does Not Mean Workaholic
          </h2>
          <blockquote className="verse-highlight">
            But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, 
            he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. — 1 Timothy 5:8 (NASB)

              Providing for your family matters. But your family needs more than money.
            </p>
            <p>
              This verse is real. Provision is a responsibility. But provide is not just financial. 
              Your family needs your presence, your attention, your spiritual leadership. 
              Working 80 hours a week to give them a bigger house while missing their childhood 
              is not provision — it is absence with a paycheck.
            </p>
            <h3>Finding Balance</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Define enough.</strong> Without a number, you will always chase more.</li>
              <li><strong>Protect family time fiercely.</strong> Work will take everything you give it.</li>
              <li><strong>Talk to your wife about money.</strong> Regularly. Openly. Without defensiveness.</li>
              <li><strong>Model work ethic and rest.</strong> Your kids are learning both from you.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Prayer</h3>
            <p>
              Lord, help me provide for my family without losing them. Give me wisdom to work hard 
              and stop well. Protect me from making an idol of my career. Amen.
